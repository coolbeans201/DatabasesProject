DatabasesProject
================

This databases project will create a webpage that will contain a comprehensive sports database, covering basketball, baseball, and hockey. The webpage will allow the user to retrieve season-by-season and career stats for players, coaches, and teams, as well as see how many standard deviations a player, coach, or team falls below or above the mean in a certain statistic. The webpage will also allow the user to sort players, coaches, or teams by a certain statistic, as well as compare two or more players, coaches, or teams on a certain statistic.
